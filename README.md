# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
  - The purpose of this analysis is to use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
## Results:
  - Data Processing
    - "IS_SUSCESSFUL" is considered the target value of the model
    - Features are individual independent variables that act as the input in the system. Thus we use the rest column values in the merged table as the features
    - The non-beneficial ID columns, 'EIN' and 'NAME' are dropped since they are neither targets nor features
  - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    - There are 81 neurons. 
    - There are 2 layers.  
    - Relu and Sigmoid function are used.

    - The accuracy is 0.7257, which did not reach the target model performance.

    - Additional layer and neurons are added to increase the performance.

    - Changing the activation function did not increase the accuracy of the model.
    - The accyract us 0.7256. Which is worse and still have not reached the target accuracy of the model.
